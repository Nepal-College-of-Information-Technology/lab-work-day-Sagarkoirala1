TITLE:Introduction to MMS Lab

OBJECTIVES:

i) To Understand the role of collaboration platforms (GitHub & Discord) in Multimedia Systems

ii)To Configure GitHub Webhooks to send automated notifications or updates to Discord channels for commits, version updates, or new tasks.

THEORY:

Multimedia System:

A Multimedia System is a computer-based system that integrates and processes multiple types of media such as text, images, graphics, audio, video, animations, and interactive content. The system allows these media elements to be created, stored, transmitted, and presented in a coordinated and synchronized manner.

Key Characteristics of a Multimedia System

i)Multimedia Integration
 - Combines text, graphics, audio, video, and animation into one system.
   
ii)Digital Representation
 - All media types are stored and processed in digital form.
   
iii)Interactivity
 - Users can interact with the content (buttons, menus, timelines).
   
iv)Synchronization
 - Media elements must play in sync ( audio matching video).
   
v)High Data Requirements
 - Needs more storage, higher bandwidth, and fast processing capabilities.

GitHub:
 A platform for storing projects, tracking changes, and collaborating using Git.

Discord:
 A communication tool with text, voice, and video channels for teamwork and community interaction.

Webhooks:
 Automatic notifications that send updates from one platform to another (GitHub to Discord).
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 GitHub, Discord, and Webhooks are essential tools for project collaboration. GitHub handles version control, Discord facilitates communication, and Webhooks   automate updates. Together, they create an efficient workflow that enhances teamwork and productivity in multimedia and software projects.
